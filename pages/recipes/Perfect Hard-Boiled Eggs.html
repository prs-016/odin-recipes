    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Use this recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. By adding a little vinegar and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking. I have been making them this way for years!</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a container of ice water or cold, running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
